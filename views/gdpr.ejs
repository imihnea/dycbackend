            <p>When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words.</p>
            <p>I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10.</p>
            <p>I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.</p>
            <p>I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text.</p>
            <p>I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."</p>
            <p>My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text.</p>
            <p>I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok?</p>
            <p>I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text.</p>
            <p>Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family.</p>
