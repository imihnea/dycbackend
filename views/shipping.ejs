            <p>
                Our policy lasts 14 days, considering we provided the shipping for the specific sale. If 14 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange.

            <p>
                Our policy is not available for goods you have received from the seller in a face to face manner, or delivered by himself. The seller can have his own return policy, which will be subjected to laws accordingly.

            <p>
                If a buyer hasn't confirmed receiving the item after 21 days of the seller confirming delivery and providing proof of it, the transaction will be closed and the seller will receive the amount owed for the product.
